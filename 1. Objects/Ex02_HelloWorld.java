/** Exercise 2:
 * Following the HelloDate.java example in this chapter, create a 
 * "hello, world" program that simply displays that statement. 
 * You need only a single method in your class (the "main" one that 
 * gets executed when the program starts). Remember to make it static 
 * and to include the argument list, even though you donâ€™t use the 
 * argument list. Compile the program with javac and run it using java. 
 * If you are using a different development environment than the JDK, 
 * learn how to compile and run programs in that environment.
 *
 * <br>
 * <b>Output:</b>
 * <pre>
 * Hello, world!
 * </pre>
 * @version 1.0
